What is NPM?
------------
NPM is a package manager for Node.js packages, or modules

What is a Package?
-----------------
A package in Node.js contains all the files you need for a module.

Modules are JavaScript libraries you can include in your project.

Download a Package
-------------------
Downloading a package is very easy.

Open the command line interface and tell NPM to download the package you want.

I want to download a package called "upper-case":

Download "upper-case":

C:\Users\Your Name>npm install upper-case
Now you have downloaded and installed your first package!

NPM creates a folder named "node_modules", where the package will be placed. All packages you install in the future will be placed in this folder.

My project now has a folder structure like this:

C:\Users\My Name\node_modules\upper-case


Using a Package
----------------
Once the package is installed, it is ready to use.

Include the "upper-case" package the same way you include any other module:

var uc = require('upper-case');
Create a Node.js file that will convert the output "Hello World!" into upper-case letters:

example
--------
var http = require('http');
var uc = require('upper-case');
http.createServer(function (req, res) {
  res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});
  res.write(uc.upperCase("Hello World!"));
  res.end();
}).listen(8080);
Save the code above in a file called "demo_uppercase.js", and initiate the file:

Initiate demo_uppercase:

C:\Users\Your Name>node demo_uppercase.js
If you have followed the same steps on your computer, you will see the same result as the example: http://localhost:8080
